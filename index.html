        <h2>Our Mission </h2>
                <p>Our mission is to promote the arts and support opportunities for cross-cultural artistic collaboration and networking amongst Gabonese, French and expat artists.

        <h2>Our Bios</h2>
            <p><strong>Sara Dolatabadi</strong> (b. 1978, Tehran, Iran) is an Iranian-French multimedia visual artist. She received her BFA from Azad Art University in Tehran (2003), and spent the next decade living and exhibiting in Tokyo, Paris and New York. While in New York, she obtained her MFA from Hunter College (2017). Her life was transformed at a young age when the Islamic Revolution changed the political landscape in Iran and by the Iran-Iraq War, which she experienced through the eyes of a child. These memories influenced her practice as a visual artist and filmmaker, which can be seen as a meeting point between the microcosm of the personal and the macrocosm of the political. For her MFA thesis she directed and produced a short documentary, Summer Light, which centers on her family and addresses the aforementioned themes.</p>

            <p><strong>Nadia Mbele</strong> (b. 1984, Klaten, Indonesia) is an Indonesian-Gabonese entreprenure. She received an MBA from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, IL, the United States (2022) and a Bachelor in Computer Science from the University of Atma Jaya, Indonesia, specializing in databases and web design (2005). Her subsequent work with a multinational company brought her to several diverse countries. These travels made her profoundly convinced that the arts are essential to society's well-being because they cultivate positive energy in every human being to leave a valuable footprint for succeeding generations. She has been the COO of Hotel Hibiscus in Libreville since 2012, where the arts consistently represent her utmost interest. Nadia has been actively organizing and promoting several arts and culture events in Gabon, together with several talented local artists. Some of those included a one-month arts exhibition in the National Museum of Arts, Rites and Traditions of Gabon (2020) and the latest 12th and 13th editions of the Fashion and Arts Award in 2018 and 2022.</p>

            <p><strong>Aschely Vaughan Cone</strong> (b. 1985, San Antonio, TX) received an MFA from the LeRoy E. Hoffberger School of Painting at the Maryland Institute College of Art (2016), an MA in Art History from Tulane University (2014) and BA in Liberal Arts from St. Johnâ€™s College (2007), where she studied classics, philosophy and the history of math and science. Her awards include a matching scholarship for study at the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, the SMCM-MICA Artist House Teaching Fellowship, the Hamiltonian Fellowship and The Henry Walters Traveling Fellowship, which brought her to Indonesia to study Javanese and Balinese batik and weaving traditions. In 2022 she was interviewed by Yale University Radio WYBCX, and recent exhibitions include Doublets at Gotham West, NYC, in 2021 and PULSE Miami in 2018.</p>
